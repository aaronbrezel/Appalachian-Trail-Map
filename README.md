# Appalachian Trail Map and Story

#Thank you to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy for making GIS data for the trail avaliable. Data is avaliable [here](http://appalachiantrail.org/home/explore-the-trail/gis-data "To the Appalachian Trail Conservancy"). 

#GIS data was downloaded and then converted to a geoJSON file format using [MyGeodata](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-geojson "MyGeodata").
