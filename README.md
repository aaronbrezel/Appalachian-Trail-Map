# [Appalachian Trail Map and Story](https://aaronbrezel.github.io/Appalachian-Trail-Map/)

## Purpose 

In the late fall of 2018, interviewed a series of Appalachian Trail thru-hikers for a story on the mental challenges of walking the trail. This project was for a writing-intensive class at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. My completed work, "Tougher than a Lighterknot," focused on experiences of one man.

That winter, I decided to experiment with using browser animations to augment the reading experience. I began by storyboarding a few potential introductions eventually settling on the presentation you see now.   

## Process



#Thank you to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy for making GIS data for the trail avaliable. Data is avaliable [here](http://appalachiantrail.org/home/explore-the-trail/gis-data "To the Appalachian Trail Conservancy"). 

#GIS data was downloaded and then converted to a geoJSON file format using [MyGeodata](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/shp-to-geojson "MyGeodata").
